# Truth Tables, Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates
In various logic families, the values and relationships between the two voltage values differ. Thus, rather than refer to the voltage levels, we talk about signals that are (logically) `true`, or `1`, or signals that are (logically) `false`, or `0`. The values 0 and 1 are called [complements or inverses](/discrete_mathematics/25-09-2024.md) of one another.

> [!NOTE]
> Asserted signal = A signal that is logically `true` or `1`.
> Deasserted signal = A signal that is logically `false` or `0`

## Truth Tables
Truth tables are one way to descripte the logic behind a logic block. It will show each possible output based on certain inputs. A logic block with n inputs will have a table with 2<sup>n</sup> entries

**Example:**
This logic function takes two inputs, A and B. It also provides two outputs C and D. The values of these outputs are based on the following logic:
1. C is true if at least on input is true
2. D is true if both input A and B are true 

| Input A | Input B | Output C | Output D |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

## Boolean Algebra
Another approach to express logic functions are with logic equations. In boolean algebra, **all values are either 0 or 1**.

**Basic operators:**
1. The `OR` operator (`+` in boolean algebra). If either or both A and B are one, OR is true. (only A + B = 0 (where A and B are 0))
2. The `AND` operator (`•` in boolean algebra). If both are 1, AND is true.
3. The `NOT` operator (`A^_`). The NOT operator inverts, 0 becomes 1 and vice versa.

**Laws**
1. Identity law: A + 0 = A, A • 1 = A
2. Zero and One lasw: A + 1 = 1, A • 0 = 0
3. Inverse laws: A + A^_ = 1, A • A^_ = 0
4. Commutative laws: A + B = B + A, A • B = B • A
5. Associative laws: A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C, A • (B • C) = (A • B) • C
6. Distributive laws: A + (B • C) = (A + B) • (A + C), A • (B + C) = (A • B) + (A • C)

Any set of logic functions can be written using these basic few operators.

**Example**
_Logic equation behind C and D from previous exercise._
C = A + B
D = A • B

## Gates
Logic blocks are made up of gates such as AND, OR and NOT. Each of these gates implement one of the afformentioned logic functions.

AND and OR are both commutative and associative so they can receive any amount of inputs. The NOT gates only operatores on one input.
